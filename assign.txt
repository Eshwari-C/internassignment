2) git push -u origin master:

The git push -u command is equivalent to -set-upstream. The -u flag is used to set origin as the upstream remote in your git config. As you push a branch successfully or up to date it, it adds upstream reference.
-u is the program which we want to share with the master branch.
After pushing our local branch with -u option, this local branch will be automatically linked with remote branch, and you can use git pull without any arguments.

origin is not the remote repository name. It is rather a local alias set as a key in place of the remote repository URL.

It avoids the user having to type the whole remote URL when prompting a push.

This name is set by default and for convention by Git when cloning from a remote for the first time.

This alias name is not hard coded and could be changed using following command prompt:

git remote rename origin mynewalias.
